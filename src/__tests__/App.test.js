/** 
 * Test cases that should be covered
 * 
 * Render without crashing
 * Render two default ToDo items
 * Render an input field for typing up new ToDo items
 * Render an ‘Add’ button for adding ToDo items
 * If the ‘Add’ button is pressed but the input field is empty, prevent a new ToDo item from being created
 * If the ‘Add’ button is pressed but the input field is empty, show an alert to the user
 * If the ‘Add’ button is pressed and the input field has content, add a new ToDo item
 * When the ‘Delete’ button is pressed for a single ToDo item, remove that ToDo item from the App
 * From the two default items in ToDo, if the first ToDo item has been removed from the app, the second item should now become the first (and only) item.
 * For the data being passed down from ToDo to ToDoItem as props, each ToDoItem should render the text that was passed down to it.
 * Each ToDoItem should render a ‘Delete’ button.
